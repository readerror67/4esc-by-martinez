The schematics includes four ESC
The layout of the PCB is by Martinez and the software is by [Simonk](https://github.com/sim-/tgy).
The Simonk software was modified by Imcoref.

We call it 4ESC.

The 4ESC is built with very fast, high-performance MOSFET-drivers and MOSFETs.

The Atmel ATmega8A is used as microcontroller.

The supply of microcontrollers, drivers and the external hardware (e.g. flight controller) is driven by an efficient DC-step-down regulator.
The step-down regulator's current-limit is 600mA.
